<h1>10 issues to consider when developing a cross-platform backup strategy<a class="headerlink" href="#issues-to-consider-when-developing-a-cross-platform-backup-strategy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Server backups are usually pretty straightforward, but things can become
complex if you have a heterogeneous network consisting of multiple server
platforms. Here some questions to consider when planning a cross platform
backup strategy.</p>
<div class="section" id="does-your-backup-application-support-all-of-the-necessary-platforms">
<h2>1 Does your backup application support all of the necessary platforms?<a class="headerlink" href="#does-your-backup-application-support-all-of-the-necessary-platforms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The most basic question you will need to consider is whether your current
backup application will even work with the “foreign” operating systems or
whether you’ll have to invest in something else.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="does-your-backup-software-support-anything-more-than-a-file-level-backup-of-other-operating-systems">
<h2>2 Does your backup software support anything more than a file level backup of other operating systems?<a class="headerlink" href="#does-your-backup-software-support-anything-more-than-a-file-level-backup-of-other-operating-systems" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is one of the most commonly overlooked considerations. To give you an
idea of what I am talking about, think about what is involved in backing up a
Windows network. Some applications (such as SQL Server and Exchange) do not
support file-level backups while the application is running. As a result,
backup software must be specifically designed to accommodate the needs of such
applications. The same thing goes for applications running on Linux or
Macintosh. Just being able to perform a file-level backup of a “foreign” server
may not be enough. You may have to invest in special backup software that can
accommodate the applications that are running on those servers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="does-your-existing-storage-media-have-the-capacity-to-back-up-the-additional-servers">
<h2>3 Does your existing storage media have the capacity to back up the additional servers?<a class="headerlink" href="#does-your-existing-storage-media-have-the-capacity-to-back-up-the-additional-servers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is a basic consideration, but it is important nonetheless. Does your
current backup infrastructure have sufficient capacity to back up the new
servers that are being introduced into the network?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-much-money-is-invested-in-your-current-backup-system">
<h2>4 How much money is invested in your current backup system?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-much-money-is-invested-in-your-current-backup-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you’re asked to bring cross-platform servers into your datacenter, you
may discover that for whatever reason, your current backup infrastructure just
can’t accommodate the new servers. When this happens, it is important to stop
and consider how much money you have invested in the current system.</p>
<p>If you’ve spent a great deal of money on the current system, you’re probably
going to make someone unhappy if you suggest replacing it with something else,
especially if the current system isn’t very old. In those types of situations,
it may be better to implement a secondary backup system that is specifically
designed for the new platform you are introducing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="if-you-end-up-replacing-your-backup-system-what-s-your-plan-for-maintaining-your-existing-archives">
<h2>5 If you end up replacing your backup system, what’s your plan for maintaining your existing archives?<a class="headerlink" href="#if-you-end-up-replacing-your-backup-system-what-s-your-plan-for-maintaining-your-existing-archives" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Suppose you discover that your existing backup system won’t support the new
platform that is being added to the network, and you decide to simply
replace it with something that’s universally compatible. You probably won’t
be able to simply get rid of your old backup hardware and software, because
it was used to create all of your archives. You need to decide how long the
existing backup system will be retained and how you will go about connecting
it to the network should a restoration of an older backup become necessary.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="are-you-familiar-enough-with-all-of-the-operating-systems-to-know-what-needs-to-be-backed-up">
<h2>6 Are you familiar enough with all of the operating systems to know what needs to be backed up?<a class="headerlink" href="#are-you-familiar-enough-with-all-of-the-operating-systems-to-know-what-needs-to-be-backed-up" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In a Windows environment, there are multiple types of backups. For example,
backing up a single server may require you to perform a file-level backup,
an application-level backup, and a system state backup. Non-Windows
operating systems may also require servers to be backed up at different
levels to be fully protected. You must make sure that you are familiar enough
with the operating systems on your network that you know how to back them
up properly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="can-you-store-data-from-multiple-platforms-on-the-same-tape">
<h2>7 Can you store data from multiple platforms on the same tape?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-you-store-data-from-multiple-platforms-on-the-same-tape" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you plan to back up multiple servers onto a single tape, you must determine
whether your backup application can write data from multiple platforms to a
single tape. In most cases, this probably won’t be a problem so long as the
backup software uses agents to communicate with target servers, but it is
still something you should check on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="are-features-such-as-bare-metal-recovery-or-restores-to-dissimilar-hardware-supported-on-the-alternate-platforms">
<h2>8 Are features such as bare metal recovery or restores to dissimilar hardware supported on the alternate platforms?<a class="headerlink" href="#are-features-such-as-bare-metal-recovery-or-restores-to-dissimilar-hardware-supported-on-the-alternate-platforms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you have been using your current backup software for a while, there are
probably some features (such as the ability to restore to dissimilar
hardware or perform bare metal recovery) that you have begun to take for
granted. However, just because a backup application supports other platforms,
it doesn’t mean that every feature will work with every supported platform.
It is important to find out whether your backup application has any
limitations in a cross-platform environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="does-your-proposed-solution-adhere-to-current-service-level-agreements">
<h2>9 Does your proposed solution adhere to current service level agreements?<a class="headerlink" href="#does-your-proposed-solution-adhere-to-current-service-level-agreements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Most larger organizations impose service level agreements on the IT
department. For example, you may be required to return the network to a
functional status within a specific amount of time in the event of a failure.
If you are going to begin backing up multiple platforms, make sure your
intended backup strategy will still allow you to meet any required service
level agreements.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="does-your-proposed-solution-comply-with-federal-archival-requirements">
<h2>10 Does your proposed solution comply with federal archival requirements?<a class="headerlink" href="#does-your-proposed-solution-comply-with-federal-archival-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many larger organizations are required by federal legislation to retain
archives for a certain amount of time. So before making any changes to
your current backup solution, determine whether your intended changes
will cause you to fall out of compliance with any regulations.</p>
