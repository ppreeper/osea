=================================================================

Deciding who to invite to project meetings is an essential step in
ensuring that the meetings are productive and reduce project costs.
Here are six ways to help decide who should be on the list.

US businesses lose around $37 billion each year due to unnecessary
meetings, and the time lost and opportunity cost due to unproductive
meetings can be compounded if there are unnecessary attendees. Project
meetings are no different. Not every project management meeting is the
same and the attendees required will vary, depending on the specific
meeting.

Here is an example of how expensive meetings can be:

If 12 people average an hourly rate of $50 and attend a one-hour weekly
meeting for 24 weeks, the cost to the project is $14,400. If only eight
people needed to be in attendance, the cost would have been $9,600. The
additional four attendees cost the project $4,800 over 24 weeks. This
may not sound like a significant number to the bottom line of a project,
but if this were to take place over 10 projects, the cost to a company
would be almost $100,000. Importantly, this cost does not factor in the
productivity lost due to the unnecessary attendance, as attendees could
be actively working on other initiatives within the business.

Before you send out the next project meeting invite, make sure that each
person on the list is directly affected by the information, has something
important to contribute, is providing a relevant update, or is in a lead
role and requires the information for decision-making. Here are some
guidelines to help you make the decision:

**1. Determine the precise purpose of the meeting and identify which
stakeholders are directly affected by the information that will be discussed.**

As a rule, if potential attendees are likely to leave the meeting without a
takeaway that directly impacts the task they are working on, they do not need
to be at the meeting. Their time is better spent moving a deliverable forward.

**2. Identify which stakeholders are relevant subject matter experts or
might have something important to share with other attendees.**

The advice provided by these attendees can be vital in how other stakeholders
proceed with their tasks. This especially holds true if the advice solves
a problem, offers new insights, or increases the chances of reaching a goal.

**3. Determine which attendees have a relevant update that other stakeholders
need to know about or are dependent on.**

Projects can run into big trouble if relevant stakeholders are not up to
date on project developments and task level updates in a timely manner.
Again, there is the important caveat about relevance: not every stakeholder
needs to know every update about every task.

**4. Identify any stakeholders in a lead role who require the updates or
information from the meeting for decision-making.**

Projects ultimately should be conducted to meet higher level company goals.
Leaders need to be current with project progress and status to make
mission-critical decisions.

**5. Contact potential attendees to discuss the meeting agenda.**

Get their feedback if you are not entirely sure whether their attendance
is necessary. Most people are busy and are unlikely to say 'yes' if they
are not adding value.

**6. Ask all attendees if they know of any others who are potentially
valuable.**

Sometimes previously unavailable insights or assistance can move a task
or project in the best direction.

Before you send out the next project meeting invite, follow these steps
to reduce resource costs, save valuable time, and focus in on meeting goals
and action items.
