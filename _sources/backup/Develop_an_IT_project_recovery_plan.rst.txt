Develop an IT project recovery plan
===================================

Takeaway: Rick Freedman presents a five-step plan for PMs tasked with rescuing
a challenged IT project. He also urges PMs to consider the emotional aspects
of project rescue.

I would bet that every project manager (PM) has heard about
link:http://www.standishgroup.com/[The Standish Group] and its
link:http://www1.standishgroup.com/newsroom/chaos_2009.php[CHAOS studies],
which purport to measure IT project success and failure rates. I say
"purport to measure" because these studies, published periodically since
1995, have link:http://theagileexecutive.com/2010/01/11/standish-group-chaos-reports-revisited/[recently been questioned],
especially by proponents of agile development. While the techniques of
the CHAOS studies can be argued, most experienced PMs will agree with one
of their key points: many projects are "challenged," struggling to deliver
the promised benefits on time and on schedule. The latest CHAOS study, for
example, places 44% of projects surveyed in the challenged category.

Many PMs have also experienced the dreaded "project that wouldn't die,"
an initiative that lost its way and careened out of control, but, due to
the difficulties associated with admitting failure, limped on for years,
wasting resources and careers along the way. Some proportion of projects
in the challenged category surely fit this description, and terminating
zombie projects is an important topic, but one for another post. In this
post we'll instead examine those projects that, although circling the drain,
are worth saving.

Notwithstanding the growth of Project Management Offices (PMOs) and the
application of robust project methodologies, projects continue to struggle
or fail, with teams, sponsors, and stakeholders denying the calamity staring
them in the face. Admitting failure in the business setting is difficult
and potentially career-threatening.

Nobody wants to raise her hand and tell sponsors that their investment is in
jeopardy and that the glowing benefits described during the initiation phase
are turning into a heap of ashes. In project rescue, admitting the problem
is often the hardest part, but it is the necessary first step to recovery.

Whether a project is on the fast track to success or the road to disaster,
the critical measurements of time, scope, budget, and quality still apply.
When one or all of these elements is out of whack, our central job in
project rescue is to:

* assess the status of those metrics objectively and dispassionately,
* perform a limited "root cause" analysis,
* develop a "get well" plan that the entire stakeholder community can believe
  and support,
* execute that plan effectively, and
* bring the project to successful closure.

We'll look at these recovery efforts in detail, but first let's touch on the
emotional aspects of project rescue.

Once it has been acknowledged that a project is in trouble, my experience is
that an explicit "get well" program is an absolute requirement for recovery.
Rather than trying to sneak in under the radar and thus shield the team from
scrutiny, a candid admission that the project is in danger and that we're
making a focused effort to set it aright is the only way to begin regaining
trust and enthusiasm. Many failing projects have acquired the aura of
inevitable disaster, making the rebuilding of belief and positive momentum a
deciding factor in recovery. PMs tasked with rescuing challenged projects
ignore these psychological aspects at their peril, as many well-intentioned
recovery programs have foundered on the rocks of despair and cynicism.

1. Assess the status dispassionately
-------------------------------------

Projects get into trouble in a variety of areas, from unrealistic budgets and
schedules to unexpected technical problems. Some common causes of project
difficulty include

* Technical challenges
* Skill mismatches or deficiencies
* Inadequate or unclear requirements
* Inadequate or unrealistic planning
* Vendor or partner failures
* Methodology weakness or misapplication

The mechanics of project assessment should be familiar to any experienced PM:
As in any discovery or due diligence effort, we need to review existing
documentation, such as plans and charts, interview participants and team
members, develop a project history that outlines the events that led to the
current challenges, and review any deliverables to assess their quality and
completeness.

There are as many reasons for project failure as there are projects, and the
emotional elements of morale, ego, and self-protection always come into play.
It's one thing for the project to run into unexpected skill-set issues, but
it's quite another for a team member to actually admit that they're not quite
the genius advertised. Team members can usually tell when a sponsor is applying
the "make-it-so" style of management, but it's another to confront that sponsor
and deflate their expectations. Project recovery teams walk a fine line in
the assessment phase, as we need to recognize and acknowledge these human as
well as substantive issues, yet remain neutral and objective so as not to
discredit our own findings.

2. Perform a limited "root cause" analysis
-------------------------------------------

Tracing challenges back to causes is critical to the development of a recovery
plan, but, again, it is a fraught exercise. The last thing a recovery team
needs is to take on the mantle of a "project audit," which is guaranteed to
trigger evasion, secrecy, and protective behavior, rather than the candor
required to determine a course correction. Facilitation techniques such as
brainstorming, link:http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTED_06.htm[force-field analysis],
and link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_analysis[pareto analysis] can be
employed, but, whatever method is used, the key is to retain a neutral,
nonjudgmental, and nonthreatening atmosphere.

3. Develop a "get well" plan
-----------------------------

The obvious starting point in the development of a project recovery plan is the
triple constraint of time, scope, and budget. My experience is that unrealistic
assumptions in one of these three areas is the underlying problem in the vast
majority of challenged initiatives. Artificial deadlines and budgets, imposed
by management fiat rather than by objective analysis, are easy to identify but
difficult to adjust, as many corporate cultures encourage the "make-it-so"
style of management and the "can-do attitude" of employees. This is where the
acknowledgment that the project is in danger of failure is a plus; it enables
us to concentrate the mind of our sponsors and remind them that unattainable
expectations, far from "making it so," instead make it fail.

The best recovery plans look at time, scope, and budget as a blank page,
avoiding the trap of getting snared in existing assumptions. The best project
recovery plans also apply strict risk management to every element of the plan,
as poor risk planning is a key cause of failure. Failing projects are orphans;
project recovery teams need to re-engage their stakeholders and convince them
that this project can be saved. Success must be redefined clearly and often
must be scoped down; one of my key questions is "what's the minimum
deliverable required to satisfy the core objectives?" All the project
disciplines, from project communication to project change management, must
be applied in a consistent manner, and strong leadership is vital.

4. Execute the project recovery plan
-------------------------------------

Execution of the recovery plan should start with a high-visibility
communication program, so that all sponsors and stakeholders know how we plan
to rescue this effort and what their role is in the recovery. Without belief
and participation, the best recovery plan has little chance. Once the
organization is behind the effort, rescue execution, like project execution,
is a matter of discipline, consistency, control, and leadership. Since these
elements are often missing in challenged projects, it's especially important
that we display them in rescue; stakeholders, even if supportive of the
rescue plan, will quickly abandon it if it starts to careen out of control
again.

5. Bring the project to closure
--------------------------------

Closure and customer acceptance are important in every project. In rescue
efforts, their significance is magnified. While few PMs would choose to
experience a failing project, the lessons we can learn from them far outweigh
those from gleaming success stories. The rescue effort has required the
team to discover and acknowledge the causes of failure, making the
retrospective that much easier by removing justification and rationalization
from the discussion. The learning opportunities afforded by challenged
projects are enormous; failing to harvest them is criminal.

Explicit acceptance of the result closes the chapter on the project and
gives us an opportunity to remind our stakeholders that even seriously
challenged projects can be saved by a healthy application of reality-based
planning and consistent discipline. Like a losing sports team that conquers
a top-ranked competitor, facing defeat and prevailing can boost confidence
and change the dynamic for the better.
