== 1. The basics

With more tech professionals swapping the cubicle for a home office, here is every home office essential, all recommended by remote workers.

For the sake of an all-encompassing list, let's start with the obvious desk basics. You'll need a workspace--most likely a desk--along with a supportive chair. Some remote workers recommend an adjustable sit-or-stand desk to switch things up. Depending on how digital you are, you'll most likely need pens, notebooks, and a space to store any files. Internet access and a reliable phone are needed to connect with others.

== 2. The electronic basics

A step above the barebones basics are the necessary electronics. You'll need a computer of some kind, but remote workers have differing recommendations as to which setup is best. Many recommended dual monitors, while others preferred a single laptop for mobility. For calls or virtual meetings, a headset with a retractable mic can help you stay connected while keeping your hands free.

== 3. The software

The specific software you'll need depends on the business and industry, but there are a few options most remote workers found essential. Video conferencing software, like Skype, and team collaboration software, like Slack, can help you stay in touch with others on your team. Other platforms, like Google Drive, are helpful for sharing files and collaborating in real-time, despite differing locations.

== 4. A door

It may seem obvious, but remote workers say you're going to need one, especially if you plan on working at home when others are there. A door will keep your workspace quiet, and will make it clear to kids and pets that now is not the time to bother you.

== 5. A posted schedule

Leave a note with information on when you're working and when you can be bothered outside of the office. Going along with the door, the schedule can help family know when you're heads-down on a project or on a call, allowing you to focus on your work without interruption.

== 6. Easy access to snacks

Whether it's a box of granola bars or a bowl of fruit, keep healthy snacks on hand near your desk. Sure, you can keep them in the kitchen, but you're more likely to stay focused if you stay in your work area instead of heading to a different room. The same rule goes for coffee, water, and tea.

== 7. Sound-cancelling headphones

Use these to drown out a neighbor mowing their lawn, or to simply zone out to some white noise.

== 8. Spotify

You can also use those headphones to listen to music, whether it's through a private collection or a streaming service like Spotify. Music can provide an energy boost, or just give you something to listen to other than your typing.

== 9. A closet

One remote worker said that, while unusual, a closet can be really helpful to cut down on background noises when making important calls. The clothes can act as sound proofing, the worker said.

== 12. Whiteboard or glassboard

Either board provides a large space to brainstorm or create a mock-up of an illustration. You can also use it to create a to-do list. One worker recommended hanging the board on the wall so you have to stand up to use it, giving you a change of scenery.

== 14. Business casual clothing

== 15. Coworking friend or space

Working remotely can get lonely, so find a friend in a similar situation who you can make plans to work with to grab some people time. Designated coworking spaces can also fill this need--see what's available in your area.

== 16. Foam roller

Maybe you forgot to take a break, or accidentally sat in a weird position for several hours. One remote worker recommends having a foam roller on hand to be able to stretch out and attend to any trouble spots.

== 17. Timer

When you're the only one working, it can be easy to get carried away and work for hours on end. Try using a timer to break up your day--one worker recommends a five minute break for every 25 minutes of work. And don't forget to set an alarm to eat lunch.

== 18. Visible reminder of your goals

Whether it's a Post-it note or a fancier piece of wall art, make sure your big goals and a reminder as to why you work are visible. Some remote workers say it keeps them motivated and focused.

== 19. Neutral backdrop

Know you'll need to do a lot of video conferencing? Determine a spot in your workspace that has a clean, neutral background for them. If you can't find one, see what you can do to make one.
