  <p>====== KPI’s and Metrics</p>
<p>DECK’s KPI’s &amp; Metrics
The following 26 KPI’s and metrics are standard inside of Spieker Point’s DECK web ecosystem. Deploying DECK to get this information at a customer site is as simple as creating a data bridge to the accounting or ERP system.</p>
<p>Metric: Operating Profit w/o Bonus/Taxes (% of Net Revenues)
Formula:
(Income Before Tax &amp; Profit Share)/Total Annual Net Revenues
Description: This is how much the firm generated in profit, as a % to net generated revenue, before taxes and profit sharing, including non-operating profits (ie. investment income). Net generated revenue is used to provide a more predictable method for comparing results in the case of highly fluctuating levels of direct expenses (ie. costs on subconsultants), w/o Ownership Dividends, Management Fees, and Management Profit Sharing.
Indicator/Ratio Type: Profitability</p>
<p>Metric: Operating Profit ( % of Net Revenues)
Formula:
Income/Total Annual Net Revenues
Description: This is how much the firm generated in profit, as a % to net generated revenue, before taxes and profit sharing, including non-operating profits (ie. investment income). Net generated revenue is used to provide a more predictable method for comparing results in the case of highly fluctuating levels of direct expenses (ie. costs on subconsultants).</p>
<p>Metric: Net Revenues per Direct Labour Hour
Formula:
(Total Annual Net Revenues)/(Total Hours Charged to Projects)
Description: This is the average net revenue earned by the firm for each hour charged to a project (ie. direct labour hour).</p>
<p>Metric: Net Direct Labour Multiplier
Formula:
(Total Annual Net Revenues)/(Direct Labour Expenses)
Description: This is the firm’s achieved multiplier for the fiscal year. It measures the ability of the firm to cover both direct project labour, the firm’s overhead, and provide a margin of profit. Indicator/Ratio Type: Profitability</p>
<p>Metric: Net Payroll Multiplier (e.g. Revenue Factor)
Formula:
Total Annual Net Revenues/(Direct Labour Expense + Indirect Labour + Fringe Expense: Vacation, Sick, Holidays + Business Development Expense: Labour)
Description: This is the ratio of net revenues to total payroll dollars and is an alternative to monitoring both net multiplier achieved and labour utilization rate. It is equal to the net multiplier achieved times the labour utilization rate.
Indicator/Ratio Type: Profitability</p>
<p>Metric: Net Revenues per Total Staff
Formula:
(Total Annual Net Revenues)/(Current Staff Count)
Description: This is average net revenues generated for each of the firm’s employees (includes principals, technical and non-technical employees).
Indicator/Ratio Type: Profitability</p>
<p>Metric: Net Revenues per Total FTEs
Formula:
(Total Annual Net Revenues)/(Current FTEs)
Description: This is average net revenues generated for each of the firm’s employees (includes principals, technical and non-technical measured in full-Dme equivalents, based on 2,080 hours per annum).
Indicator/Ratio Type: Profitability</p>
<p>Metric: Operating Overhead Rate (before Incentive/Bonus)
Formula:
(Total General Overhead)/(Direct Labour Expenses)
Description: This is the ratio of all general overhead costs to the direct labour expenses charged to projects.
Indicator/Ratio Type: Profitability</p>
<p>Metric: Chargeability Ratio (Payroll Dollars)
Formula:
Direct Labour Expenses/(Direct Labour Expense + Indirect Labour + Fringe Expense: Vacation, Sick, Holidays + Business Development Expense: Labour)
Indicator/Ratio Type: Profitability</p>
<p>Metric: Chargeability Ratio (Payroll Hours)
Formula:
Direct Labour Expenses/(Direct Labour Hours + Indirect Labour Hours + Opportunity Labour Hours)
Indicator/Ratio Type: Profitability</p>
<p>Metric: Direct Labour Costs per Direct Labour Hour
Formula:
(Direct Labour Expenses)/(Total Hours Charged to Projects)
Description: This is the average cost of labour for all billable hours.
Indicator/Ratio Type: Profitability</p>
<p>Metric: Average Collection Period (Days)
Formula:
Average Accounts Receivable/(Total Annual Gross Revenue/365)
Description: This is the average number of days it takes for the firm to be paid for services rendered (ie. collect accounts receivable)
Indicator/Ratio Type: Activity</p>
<p>Metric: Work in Process (e.g. unbilled fees) (Days)
Formula:
Average Work in Progress/(Total Annual Gross Revenue/365)
Indicator/Ratio Type: Activity</p>
<p>Metric: Equity per Total Staff
Formula:
Total Equity/Current Staff Count
Indicator/Ratio Type: Profitability</p>
<p>Metric: Target Direct Labour Multiplier
Formula:
Target Direct Labour Multiplier
Description: The firm’s aggressive target multiplier. Can be compared to KPI #3 - Net Direct Labour Multiplier Achieved
Indicator/Ratio Type: Profitability</p>
<p>Metric: Gross Revenue Change
Formula:
% Change in Gross Revenue over past 12 months
Indicator/Ratio Type: Profitability</p>
<p>Metric: Backlog Change
Formula:
% Change in Backlog over past 12 months
Indicator/Ratio Type: Activity</p>
<p>Metric: Staff Size Change
Formula:
(Current Staff Count - (Current Staff Count - Staff Joined + Staff Left))/((Current Staff - Staff Joined + Staff Left))
Description: The current ratio is a measure of short-term financial strength. A commonly used measure that indicates the firm’s ability to meet current Liabilities using current assets.
Indicator/Ratio Type: Activity</p>
<p>Metric: Current Ratio - excl. Deferred Taxes
Formula:
Current Asset/(Current Liabilities - Deferred Taxes)
Description: The Current Ratio is mainly used to give an idea of the firm’s ability to pay back short-term Liabilities (debt and payables) with short-term assets (cash, inventory, receivables). The higher the current ratio, the more capable a company is of paying its obligations.
Indicator/Ratio Type: Liquidity</p>
<p>Metric: Current Ratio
Formula:
Current Asset/(Current Liabilities)
Description: The Current Ratio is mainly used to give an idea of the firm’s ability to pay back short-term Liabilities (debt and payables) with short-term assets (cash, inventory, receivables). The higher the current ratio, the more capable a company is of paying its obligations.
Indicator/Ratio Type: Liquidity</p>
<p>Metric: Days Sales in Receivables
Formula:
Receivables/(Sales / 365)
Description: The Days Sales in Accounts Receivable Ratio, also known as the number of days of receivables, indicates the average number of days it takes to collect an account receivable. Since this indicator is an average, caution should be exercised when using it.
Indicator/Ratio Type: Activity</p>
<p>Metric: Occupancy Cost Ratio
Formula:
(Rent + Utilities + Taxes)/Total Revenue
Description: Occupancy costs are those costs related to the firm’s occupancy of space including; rent, taxes where ownership is applicable, insurance on building and contents, depreciation, and amortization expenses.
Indicator/Ratio Type: Activity</p>
<p>Metric: Overhead Cost Ratio
Formula:
Overhead Expense/Total Revenue
Description: The Overhead Cost ratio explains the difference between the gross margin and operating margin. It shows what proportion of sales is spent on overhead, also called sales, general and administrative costs. These are all operating costs other than the cost of goods sold.
Indicator/Ratio Type: Activity</p>
<p>Metric: Gross Profit Margin
Formula:
Revenue/Direct Expense
Description: Gross profit is a very simple measure of profit. Given that it excludes many costs, including all overheads and all financing costs, it is not a good measure of how profitable the firm may be as a whole, but rather of how much of a markup can be made on sales. Gross margin is also a measure of efficiency. If a company has a higher gross margin than its peers it must either have differentiated its products so as to get a higher price, or it must be more efficient and have lower costs.
Indicator/Ratio Type: Profitability</p>
<p>Metric: NET Profit Margin
Formula:
Net Profit/Total Revenue
Description: This firm’s Net Profit Margin following the issuance of Management Fees or Dividends.
Indicator/Ratio Type: Profitability</p>
<p>Metric: Aged WIP &gt; 30, 60, 90, &gt;120 Days
Description: Aged Work In Progress (WIP) shows the value of work complete but not invoiced, and allows the firm to quickly determine what hasn’t been invoiced in order to establish why and when.
Indicator/Ratio Type: Activity</p>
