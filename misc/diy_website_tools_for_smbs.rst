For owners and operators of SMBs, these online tools will help you improve your web presence on a smaller budget in areas including e-commerce, marketing, and web development.

As a small- or medium-size business owner, you might not have the time to devote to planning, designing, creating and developing your own websites and incorporating an e-commerce and marketing strategy along with your business technology. Many SMB owners have no idea where to start or what to choose when it comes to creating their website or improving their current online presence.

This list for SMBs includes a kit of e-commerce tools, online marketing tools, and website development tools, including a short review of fifteen resources in the three categories. You can then make your own choices based on your needs and requirements of the various instruments, whether starting a new or improving your current website.
