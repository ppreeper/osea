  <p>Five beliefs that can take down an IT leader
Jason Hiner: Is your way of thinking impeding your progress? This is a major problem for any individual – but it’s much more serious if you re in charge of an IT department. There have been many IT groups that could have been tremendously successful if it weren’t for the faulty beliefs of their leaders.</p>
<p>I’m Jason Hiner, and today on Sanity Savers for IT Executives, I’ll going to put the spotlight on five ways of thinking that can cripple your IT operation and damage your career.</p>
<p>#1. The business must identify its technology needs</p>
<p>Who is more valuable to you, someone who knows how to tighten a bolt or someone who knows which bolt to tighten? We now operate in a knowledge economy and knowing what to do is much more valuable than being able to follow instructions.</p>
<p>If you believe the business should identify technology needs, you’re wrong. You need the business to identify business issues, opportunities, and priorities. Then you and your people have to come up with a way of addressing them from the technology perspective.</p>
<p>You’re the experts in technology, not the CFO or the Director of Marketing. If you think your department should simply implement and maintain the technology that the business chooses, then you’re positioning yourself as the person who tightens bolts. The IT departments that fall into this trap usually get outsourced.</p>
<p>#2. We are such a fast-paced IT department</p>
<p>These days, nearly everyone claims to be “fast-paced,” but the implications of this concept can be dangerous. It’s important to understand how that assertion affects the people within the organization.</p>
<p>If you’re constantly told that you re incredibly busy, you start believing it’s true – and your capacity decreases. If you re told that there’s no time to think, you sacrifice the quality of your decisions for the sake of speed, even though there may be plenty of time to plan and execute. The result is an organization with a high rate of project failures that’s too focused on firefighting and too “busy” to think strategically and identify work that’s truly important.</p>
<p>You can never be too busy for the important stuff if you get your priorities right.</p>
<p>#3. We are under-resourced</p>
<p>There are plenty of IT executives who blame all their problems on a lack of resources. It happens in organizations where there are staff members who can’t coherently explain what they do, where there are 10 project managers for every project, where every trivial thing involves days of meetings, and where out of every 10 projects going at any time, eight have no business value.</p>
<p>The fact is that never have enough time, staff, or money if your priorities are out of order. The key is to use the resources you have so that they produce the best return-on-investment possible.</p>
<p>#4. Projects can’t be approved unless they save costs or generate revenue</p>
<p>Operating entirely in cost-cutting mode will hamper your ability to think in terms of growth. If you merely concentrate on the financial side of costs and benefits, you re killing innovation in your organization. How innovative are you likely to be if every suggestion you make is evaluated only in respect to its financial benefit?</p>
<p>You need to consider the costs and benefits of any project in a broader sense than just the short-term dollars and cents. This is a skill that fuels innovation and positions you as a thought leader because some of the biggest and best ideas involve a little bit of short term risk but have the potential to be long-term game-changers.</p>
<p>#5. In difficult times, we always cut costs</p>
<p>Prudent financial management is a must at all times, good and bad. But it’s impossible to become successful just by pinching pennies. It simply doesn’t happen.</p>
<p>The best value generated by an IT department today does not lie in trivial cost-cutting but in innovation, business alignment, and strategic thinking. Your organization needs new ideas, bold thinking, and a full understanding of business priorities. You need to think about the needs of tomorrow, and not just the adversity of today.</p>
<p>Using the criteria we’ve discussed today, IT leader should analyze their thinking to ensure that they’re not harboring any false beliefs that could be holding back their IT departments. If you find yourself operating under any the assumptions we’ve looked at, you could be jeopardizing the success of your IT organization – and your own career.</p>
