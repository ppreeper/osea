Metric: Gross Profit Margin 
Formula: 
Revenue/Direct Expense 
Description: Gross profit is a very simple measure of profit. Given that it excludes many costs, including all overheads and all financing costs, it is not a good measure of how profitable the firm may be as a whole, but rather of how much of a markup can be made on sales. Gross margin is also a measure of efficiency. If a company has a higher gross margin than its peers it must either have differentiated its products so as to get a higher price, or it must be more efficient and have lower costs.
