  <p>= Boost your crowdfunding campaign with these 10 tips</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>By Lyndsey Gilpin December 4, 2014, 4:54 AM PST // lyndseygilpin</p></li>
<li><p><strong>After the initial donations flow in, you need to gain more momentum for your crowdfunding campaign. Here are 10 ways to do it.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>You worked for months building your crowdfunding campaign. You made your prototype, shot a video, wrote your pitch,
practiced your spiel, and designed your website. The campaign finally goes live ­­ and your friends and family
immediately back you. But after a quick start, you’re left wondering how to gain more momentum. After all, campaigns
go viral on Indiegogo and Kickstarter all the time. How do you wake up to 1,000 backers and an over­funded campaign?</p>
<p>In the spirit of full disclosure, I am currently running a crowdfunding campaign for a book project, so figuring out how to
find more backers consumes a lot of my thoughts. But it’s important stuff, because promoting your campaign is the
most challenging aspect of this process.</p>
<p>So, here are 10 ways to boost your campaign.</p>
<p>== 1. Look at your pitch again</p>
<p>[Georgia Tech researchers](<a class="reference external" href="http://comp.social.gatech.edu/papers/cscw14.crowdfunding.mitra.pdf">http://comp.social.gatech.edu/papers/cscw14.crowdfunding.mitra.pdf</a>) looked at nine million phrases from
45,000 Kickstarter campaigns and found some of the most used phrases from campaigns that were fully funded vs.
more unsuccessful campaigns. Most of the successful campaigns used persuasive phrases, as you’d probably
imagine. Some of the popular phrases used: “good karma,” “got you,” “given the chance,” “future is,” “some help with,”
and, of course, “cats.”</p>
<p>Some words that didn’t work well? “Hope to get,” provide us,” “need one,” and “we have lots.”</p>
<p>== 2. Update</p>
<p>[According to Indiegogo](<a class="reference external" href="https://go.indiegogo.com/playbook">https://go.indiegogo.com/playbook</a>/life­cycle­phase/running­your­campaign) , projects that post at least three
updates throughout their campaign raise 239% more money than those who don’t post updates. Really, the more
updates you send, the more money you raise. Send one every few days. Thank your contributors, tell them about new
news you have about your product, share your achievements, and let them know if there are any changes. Keep
engaging your community.</p>
<p>== 3. Run referral contests</p>
<p>Referral contests work well to motivate people to share your campaign. Recognize your backers who send people your
way or share your information on social media. Indiegogo has a help center for running a [referral contest](<a class="reference external" href="http://support.indiegogo.com/hc">http://support.indiegogo.com/hc</a>/en­us/articles/527406­How­to­Run­a­Referral­Contest) .
Typically, referral contests work better 30 days
into the campaign, or when 60% of the funding goal has already been reached, so you have your base audience.</p>
<p>== 4. Make a social media strategy</p>
<p>Obviously, this one is huge. But for good reason ­­ your social media strategy determines whether your crowdfunding
campaign lives or dies. You’re not going to get backers by relying on people to browse through campaigns on the
platforms. You have to reach out to them. Ask your most committed inner circle to share with at least five of their
friends, for instance. Personally reach out to people on Facebook and Twitter. Cross­promote. And instead of focusing
on making your campaign go viral, focus on what you can control. Be consistent with your audience, but switch up your
posts.</p>
<p>== 5. Buzzstream</p>
<p>When you install the [Buzzmarker Chrome extension](<a class="reference external" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail</a>/buzzstream­-buzzmarker/difjajjajoeppdgbcbbhbdblblmkcbhp?hl=en­US) ,
you just have to click on the page and “Buzzmark it” and it identifies
the contact email for you for that particular page or blog. [Buzzstream](<a class="reference external" href="http://www.buzzstream.com/">http://www.buzzstream.com/</a>) also has a “prospecting
list” feature that shows you where other blog links are on the site. Big time saver. There’s also a free trial for two
weeks, which is just enough time for you to use it during your crowdfunding campaign.</p>
<p>== 6. Scout your competition</p>
<p>Guaranteed, your project has some competition on Kickstarter and Indiegogo, and probably on smaller crowdfunding
sites, too. But for starters, use Google to search campaigns like yours on Kickstarter and Indiegogo, find out who
covered them in the media, and reach out to those reporters or blogs. You can also use Google image search for this ­­
save a few images from the campaign, drag them into Google image search tool, and backtrack to find out who covered
them when the images show up on the results page.</p>
<p>== 7. Buzzsumo</p>
<p>[Buzzsumo](<a class="reference external" href="http://buzzsumo.com/">http://buzzsumo.com/</a>) allows you to search for Twitter influencers based on topic. Type in “crowdfunding” in the
search bar, and you’ll find the most talked about campaigns and who has mentioned them. (Unfortunately, the [potato salad](<a class="reference external" href="https://app.buzzsumo.com">https://app.buzzsumo.com</a>/top­content?type=articles&amp;result_type=total&amp;num_days=360&amp;general_article&amp;infographic&amp;video&amp;guest_post&amp;giveaway&amp;interview&amp;q=crowdfunding&amp;page=1) Kickstarter is still winning out
with this search). Buzzsumo is a great way to find who is talking about things related to your campaign. Then you can
personally tweet at them or engage them to pique their interest and start attracting a bigger audience.</p>
<p>== 8. Add perks</p>
<p>If you’re doing well, add a perk or update the ones you have. To engage people in your campaign more, offer a live
stream or live video, or a Twitter chat to talk about the product. Make a hashtag and promote it. Invite influencers you
know on social media to help you out. You need to build that audience, and people want to see who is behind the
product they’re looking at. Make yourself accessible by doing a video Q &amp; A about your campaign, or offer incentives to
get people to contribute.</p>
<p>== 9. HARO</p>
<p>Help a [Reporter Out](<a class="reference external" href="http://www.helpareporter.com/">http://www.helpareporter.com/</a>) is a popular way for journalists to find sources for their stories. It’s also a
pretty nice way to get the press interested in your campaign, if you act fast enough. If a reporter mentions something
related to your product or campaign and you think you might make a good source for their story, hit them up. They get
an example for their story, and you probably get a link to your campaign in the article. It’s a win­win. But as a reporter
who likes HARO, heed my advice: don’t waste your time contacting journalists who have nothing to do with your
product. Do your research.</p>
<p>== 10. Kicktraq</p>
<p>[Kicktraq](<a class="reference external" href="http://www.kicktraq.com/">http://www.kicktraq.com/</a>) mainly does analytics for Kickstarter, but it can also be used to search the internet for
mentions of your competitors’ campaigns. Find out who covered them, and then pitch those members of the media. Or,
it may simply give you inspiration on how best to promote, update, or market your product during the rest of your
campaign.</p>
