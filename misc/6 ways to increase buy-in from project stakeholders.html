<h1>6 ways to increase buy-in from project stakeholders<a class="headerlink" href="#ways-to-increase-buy-in-from-project-stakeholders" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>By Moira Alexander | April 12, 2018, 6:24 AM PST</p>
<p>Gaining trust and cooperation from a project team is imperative for success.
Here are some ways to improve communication with stakeholders and make sure
they feel like an important part of a team.</p>
<p>Buy-in can be a difficult thing to quantify, especially within various
stakeholder categories. Without full buy-in from team members, sponsors and
other stakeholders, projects may seem to be progressing smoothly and then
suddenly take a sharp turn for the worst, risking the final deliverables and
customer satisfaction. Depending on the reasons for the change, this can
pose significant challenges for project managers when trying to get things
back on track. Here are six ways to increase stakeholder buy-in through
each stage of a project and smooth a path towards success.</p>
<p><strong>1. Identify what motivates stakeholders</strong></p>
<p>If you can gain an understanding of what motivates each stakeholder, it can
become much easier to get a larger share of stakeholder buy-in. This may
seem time-consuming up front but can help significantly maintain buy-in as
a project progresses. Within the same company, individuals and teams may
be motivated by completely different things. Teams may be motivated by
financial rewards like bonuses or raises or performance benchmarks, while
individuals may be motivated by work-life balance or opportunities for
career growth. A key to being able to establish higher degrees of buy-in
is in establishing the link between project and company goals and stakeholder
values and motivations. This does not need to be a secret mission, but
instead a direct dialogue with stakeholders to help identify and establish
the linkage. It’s important to note that it may not always be possible to
meet all the factors that motivate stakeholders.</p>
<p><strong>2. Focus on telling the truth, even when it isn’t what stakeholders
want to hear</strong></p>
<p>Building a culture of trust is vital if you expect stakeholders to buy
into a project and execute tasks to the best of their abilities.
Overall, environmental factors such as low morale, negative culture,
and lack of trust could make stakeholders believe their contribution
isn’t valuable. If stakeholders feel there is a disconnect with a project
manager, sponsor, team, functional unit, customer, or the company, they
are likely to have a deep sense of distrust.</p>
<p>Get serious about the impact of this issue - it can have the power to
ruin projects quickly. Be transparent about any issues that may be of
concern and solicit feedback from key stakeholders. Avoid offering
solutions that you are unsure you can deliver on. Rather, say, “I don’t
know, but I will look into that and let you know.” Most stakeholders
will be more trusting of you if you tell them the truth even if the
answer isn’t what they prefer. Be honest about issues and remain objective
about solutions as this too can help to establish trusting relationships
and increase buy-in.</p>
<p><strong>3. Make sure stakeholders understand their contribution to a project</strong></p>
<p>Once you’ve been able to identify individual stakeholder motivations and
focus on gaining their trust, drawing a direct line between what motivates
them and project goals becomes much simpler. Determine how project goals
benefit stakeholders and communicate this, allowing stakeholders to share
their concerns and ideas. It is much easier to solidify buy-in if
stakeholders fully understand how their contributions impact a project and
how the project outcome impacts them in return. When the lines are blurred,
it can create confusion and reduced interest, make sure you are able to
clearly define their direct role and the project goals in relation to the
other.</p>
<p><strong>4. Reaffirm goals and communicate progress throughout execution</strong></p>
<p>It’s not enough to set goals and establish a linkage between stakeholder
performance at the beginning of a project. Throughout execution, project
managers should ensure they reaffirm goals and update stakeholders on the
progress. This information is useful in ensuring stakeholders are engaged
from the beginning of a project to close. Often once a project is being
executed, it becomes assumed that stakeholders understand their role and
can remain focused on deliverables. This assumption can easily become a
pitfall that derails a project. It’s important to remind stakeholders about
project goals and their role in reaching those goals throughout the project
to avoid decreased buy-in.</p>
<p><strong>5. Remain consistent</strong></p>
<p>Make sure to remain consistent in what you say and how often you communicate.
As the project leader, your responsibility is to provide guidance and
consistency throughout every stage of the project. Stakeholders need to
know you are always there, always approachable, and consistent. This
provides stakeholders with the much-needed stability necessary to remain
vested.</p>
<p><strong>6. Provide positive feedback after the project ends</strong></p>
<p>It isn’t enough to only provide feedback on lessons learned at the end of a
project. If you simply offer feedback around needed improvements, you are
unlikely to re-establish trust or gain buy-in on the next project. Once a
project has wrapped up, remember to thank your team and other stakeholders
for their contributions and commitment; also, provide positive feedback
about how stakeholder activities may have helped throughout project
execution. This last step is simply considered good leadership.</p>
