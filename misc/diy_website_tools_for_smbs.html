<p>For owners and operators of SMBs, these online tools will help you improve your web presence on a smaller budget in areas including e-commerce, marketing, and web development.</p>
<p>As a small- or medium-size business owner, you might not have the time to devote to planning, designing, creating and developing your own websites and incorporating an e-commerce and marketing strategy along with your business technology.

<p>This list for SMBs includes a kit of e-commerce tools, online marketing tools, and website development tools, including a short review of fifteen resources in the three categories. You can then make your own choices based on your needs and requirements of the various instruments, whether starting a new or improving your current website.</p>
